Hi, I'm Karl 👋

Software Engineering student (UK) focused on building practical Python projects with clean structure and reproducible workflows.

What I'm working on

-   From-scratch ML implementations (so models aren't a black box)

-   Data tooling and small utilities (CLI-first, modular code, clear docs)

-   Longer-term: end-to-end data projects (cleaning → analysis → reporting → evaluation)

Featured projects

-   Quant-Core Engine --- from-scratch logistic regression (mini-batch GD, L2, save/load artifacts, ROC-AUC + plots)\
    https://github.com/cotenthusiast/quant-core-engine

-   Polynomial Regression From Scratch --- gradient descent, feature scaling, loss curves\
    https://github.com/cotenthusiast/polynomial-regression-from-scratch

-   Data Analyzer CLI --- command-line CSV exploration and summaries\
    https://github.com/cotenthusiast/data-analyzer-cli

-   Anime Recommender (WIP) --- dataset ingestion/preprocessing + baseline recommendations\
    https://github.com/cotenthusiast/anime-recommender

Tech I use

-   Python, Java

-   NumPy, pandas, matplotlib

-   Git/GitHub, VS Code

How I build

-   Small, testable modules

-   Reproducible scripts (train/evaluate)

-   Clear READMEs and saved artifacts for reruns
