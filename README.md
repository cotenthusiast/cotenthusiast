Hi, I'm Karl 👋

Software Engineering student (UK) building practical Python projects in data + ML with clean structure and reproducible workflows.

Current focus / goals

-   Build strong fundamentals by implementing core ML algorithms from scratch (so models aren't a black box)

-   Ship clean, modular projects with clear READMEs, scripts, and reproducible results

-   Grow a consistent open-source portfolio with progressively larger end-to-end projects
